## What is Gatsby

Gatsby is a JavaScript web framework that lets you build fast, dynamic,
mobile-ready websites _without_ an advanced degree in JavaScript wizardry.

It combines the fast performance of static websites with the powerful
abstractions, tools, and client capabilities of the React.js world.

Gatsby is your friendly, blazing fast static site generator for React. And after
nearly a year of research, prototyping, and testing, Gatsby v1 is ready for
action.

Static site generators offer many benefits over traditional dynamic website
frameworks â€” _better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a
better developer experience._
